Simplified version of the Nova ECS.

THIS IS NOT PRODUCTION READY CODE!

It has been stripped down from the ECS implementation in Nova, has not been tested, and serves for educational purposes only. Some of the design decisions might not make sense in this stripped down version, but they're a consequence of the full system. That said, if you want to submit patches for correctness (not increasing the complexity of this example code), please do so!

Nova is the engine that powers Jupiter Hell ( http://jupiterhell.com ). The full implementation, as well as the engine itself, might be open sourced some day, but no sooner than the full release of Jupiter Hell.
